# ML-behavior-sensing
This project was conducted as a part of the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program at Purdue University. The purpose of this project was to develop a Python program to detect anomalies in college student's behavior by applying clustering machine learning algorithms to user's mobile GPS data and calculate data metrics tied to anomalous behavior.
